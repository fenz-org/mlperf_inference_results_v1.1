# R7525 System Architecture

The [Dell EMC PowerEdge R7525](https://www.delltechnologies.com/asset/en-us/products/servers/technical-support/dell-emc-poweredge-r7525-spec-sheet.pdf) system supports the [GPUDirect](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpudirect) capability of NVIDIA GPUs to transfer data direct from PCIe devices (e.g. network, storage, or camera) directly to GPU device memory. The R7525 is a switchless, PCIe-Gen4 server with two 3rd Generation AMD EPYC processors. The tested config has a 1-to-1 ratio of A100 PCIe or A30 GPUs to Mellanox CX6 NICs.

We enabled GPUDirect on ResNet50, SSD-ResNet34, DLRM, RNNT and BERT based on Dell's internal bandwidth measurements. 

We also enabled the end_on_device flag for 3D-Unet based on those same internal bandwidth measurements.
