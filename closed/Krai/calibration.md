# Krai - Quantization Details

## TFLite/ArmNN results

We use quantized TFLite models shared by Google.
We believe that Google used [post-training quantization](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quantization) via the [TFLite converter](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/convert/).

## TensorRT results

Please refer to NVIDIA's [v1.0 calibration document](https://github.com/mlcommons/inference_results_v1.0/blob/master/closed/NVIDIA/calibration.md).
