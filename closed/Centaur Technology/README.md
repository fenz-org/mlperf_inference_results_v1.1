# Centaur Technology AI Coprocessor (CT-AIC)

Centaur's microprocessor-design technology includes both a high-performance
x86 core and the industry's first integrated AI Coprocessor for x86 systems.
The x86 microprocessor cores deliver high instructions/clock (IPC) for
server-class applications and support the latest x86 extensions such as
AVX512. The AI Coprocessor is a clean-sheet processor designed to deliver high
performance and efficiency on deep-learning applications, freeing up the x86
cores for general-purpose computing.
